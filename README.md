# QuickBB and tools
This is a convenience repository of the QuickBB program by Vibhav Gogate.
The original binary version is available [here](http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vgogate/quickbb.html).
This repository provides a Dockerfile to build a minimal container to run quickbb on Mac OS X.
The script run_quickbb.sh can be used in the same way as the original binary.
The script starts a container of the image called qbit271/quickbb and passes all command line
arguments to it.
The test file test.cnf is an input example of the SAT format. A more detailed description is
given in the file satformat.ps.
